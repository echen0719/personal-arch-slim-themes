# Some SLiM Themes

I installed and use Linux (Arch BTW) as my operating on a daily basis. I could use CLI but I do want a good-looking, simple, memory efficent display manager that greets meet on startup and locks my screen when I am away. Here are some of my SLiM themes to share.

## Installion

1. According to your Linux distro, find the SLiM package in their repositories.
2. Install SLiM using distro package manager.
